# ethereum-final-year-project
As part of my final year research project, I am conducting sentiment analysis on tweets mentioning Ethereum around times of major spikes in price. With this information, this research project aims to determine an Ethereum trading strategy to see if we can deduce when the optimal time to buy/sell during a spike is based on Twitter data.

I will be using this page to store data and add updates from time to time.
